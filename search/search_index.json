As a result we will be using Javascript to update the page and control CSS to give the user updates. We will start simply but these will become web Apps, then eventually we will progress to creating an App for a mobile device, using the same knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS. HTML is the content, CSS is the design and JS becomes the behaviour or controls the page interactions. \n\n\nInstructor: Ryan Price  \n\nEmail: \nryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca\n  \n\nOffice hours: upon appointment\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\nMy office time is split between B122D \n J119.

An assignment submitted within one week (5 business days) after the due date, will receive a 10% grade reduction. \nAssignments more than one week late will not be graded\n unless a prior arrangement has been made with your professor.\n\n\nIf there is a valid reason for the late assignment, the student must email their professor as soon as possible, and no later than the date the assignment is due to indicate it will be late. If the reason is deemed to be valid, there will be no late penalty.\n\n\nThere will be no resubmission of work unless, under exceptional circumstances, this has been agreed to or suggested by the professor.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n - Computer hardware/software failure does not constitute a valid reason for a late assignment, please make regular back-ups of your work to ensure timely delivery of your project. Extra storage on \nDropbox\n is available using this link.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\n\nThe principle of academic honesty requires that all work submitted for evaluation and course credit be the original, unassisted work of the student. Cheating or plagiarism including borrowing, copying, purchasing or collaborating on work, except for group projects arranged and approved by the faculty member, or otherwise submitting work that is not the student\u2019s own violates this principle and will not be tolerated. Instances of academic dishonesty, including assisting another student to cheat, will be penalized as detailed in the Student Handbook.\n\n\nStudents who have any questions regarding whether or not specific circumstances involve a breach of academic honesty are advised to discuss them with the faculty member prior to submitting the assignment in question. For more info, see Sheridan's \nAcademic Integrity\n page.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\n\nTo achieve the critical performance, students will have demonstrated the ability to:\n\n\n\n\nResearch and analyze interactive objects to identify elements and relationships.\n\n\nApply visual design principles to interactive problem solving.\n\n\nApply the terminology and principles of information architecture in interactive problem solving.\n\n\nProduce process documents such as diagrams, briefs and storyboards.\n\n\nIntegrate project concepts into functioning interactions.\n\n\nApply design principles such as sequence and priority to solving interactive problems.\n\n\nIntegrate technical parameters and platforms into the development of design solutions.\n\n\nExhibit professional behaviours including:\n\n\nopenness to peer critiques\n\n\nacceptance of differing viewpoints\n\n\nwillingness to work collaboratively\n\n\ncommitment to meeting project due dates\n\n\nresponsibility for self direction\n\n\ncommitment to the responsible use of reference materials.",

Your task is to create a dynamic page that Javascript writes into \nafter\n the page has loaded. Your content can be animated, textual, graphical or can be a mixture of all. It can require user input or just write directly in. Your content should consider text, graphics and animation to enhance the interaction.\n\n\nYou can create your own project idea or one of the following: \n- Area or perimeter calculator\n- Tip calculator\n- Grade calculator\n- Lottery Number generator\n\n\nDeliverables\n\n\n\n\nDemonstration of the working web page in a presentation.\n\n\nBlog post of the working project, discussing the project from conception to creation.

Extra storage on \nDropbox\n is available using this link.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\n\nThe principle of academic honesty requires that all work submitted for evaluation and course credit be the original, unassisted work of the student. Cheating or plagiarism including borrowing, copying, purchasing or collaborating on work, except for group projects arranged and approved by the faculty member, or otherwise submitting work that is not the student\u2019s own violates this principle and will not be tolerated.
