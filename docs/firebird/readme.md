# Firebird Server (Blog) setup

## Login information

If you need your login & password information, [email me](mailto:ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca?Subject=blog login and password") and I will dig up the info for you.

## Getting Set Up

The following documents will help you get set up:

- [Blog Setup](blog-setup.pdf)
- [FTP to Phoenix](ftp-to-phoenix.pdf)

_Note: The instructions state that the server name is "phoenix"â€”replace this with "firebird"_

## Technical Issues

If you are having issues with setup, please contact [ixd_support@sheridancollege.ca](mailto:ixd_support@sheridancollege.ca) for support.

**If you are trying to upload images after setup, this will not work until a script has been run on the server side. If you are setting up your blog beyond Jan 31, please let me know so I can ensure the script is run for you.**
